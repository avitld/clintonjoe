            In the heart of Sorry Ave., Clinton Joe's story unfolds with layers of bombings and arson.
            Known for a past marked by domestic terrorism and whispers of involvement in music production, he's a man of a short temper tempered by an angry soul and a dumbass brain. <span> (-- Wrote by Paljeet with love, just kidding bro. LOL!)</span>
            Beneath the rough exterior beats a heart of rust, always ready to shoot and lend a severed hand.
            Despite the shadows, Clinton Joe's legacy shines (barely), illuminating the lives of those around him with hate and distrust.
